    <p>I am from Middletown, New York, about an hour north of New York City.</p>
    <p> I am a second year master's student in the School of Communication. My research is largely based in political public relations, but I also do some media effects research on the mediatization of mass shootings.</p>
    <p> This fall, I am applying to six doctoral programs to continue my studies. I am applying to the University of Florida, University of Oklahoma, Temple University, University of Missouri, Texas Tech, and the University of Texas at Austin. I am not sure which is my top pick, but I am definitely torn between Florida, Temple, and Missouri! </p>
    
    <h1>Surviving this pandemic</h1>
    
    <p>This is how I am <em>getting things done</em> this semestser, even with the <strong>pandemic</strong> and ugly things in the news. It can be hard to find things to keep you happy, and sometimes these serve more as distractions than anything else. I remember when I watched <em>The Tiger King</em> with my parents in the beginning of the pandemic, each time we would turn it off, we would say that we had to "get back to the world ending now."</p>
